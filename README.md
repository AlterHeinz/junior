software and other resources concerning my junior computer

My junior computer is nearly 40 years old and has rested in my cellar for over 30 years.
When I switched it on again recently, it worked as before! Except that there was no external storage media left: no audio tape, no floppy disk drive.

I felt like creating a new external storage: why not connect junior to my laptop? junior could do serial communication! So I bought an USB-to-Serial-Adapter an constructed a new hardware component for junior which provided an RS-232-connector. 

This git project contains 
*  a console program which can connect to junior and transfer data in both directions. In a quite experimental way, still.
